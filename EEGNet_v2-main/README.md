# EEGNet_v2
using generative model incresing the accuracy of eegnet model


# To do
- [x] make training.py modular 
- [x] show the tradeoff for various capacity of synthetic training data on vae, cgan and wgan. 



# Task
- [ ] Trained a vae seperately 
- [ ] Used the trained vae in training of EEGNet (do not used the fixed generated data by vae during training of EEGNet)
- [ ] uploaded vae_training  , vae model, eeg model, training programs
- [ ]
